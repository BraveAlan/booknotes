# 21. Channels - The Go Way to do concurrency synchronizations

Don't (let computations) communicate by sharing memroy, (let them) share memory by communicating (through channels).

五种操作(all these operations are already synchronized)：

- close(ch), ch must not be a receive-only channel.
- `ch <- v`, send a value
- `<-ch`, receive a value from the channel
- cap(ch), value buffer capacity, return int
- len(ch), query current number of values in the value buffer

We can think of each channel as maintaining 3 queues:
- the receiving goroutine queue
- the sending goroutine queue
- the value buffer queue

```go
// unbufferd demo
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	c := make(chan int)
	go func(ch chan<- int, x int) {
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		ch <- x * x //block until the result is received.
	}(c, 3)

	done := make(chan struct{})

	go func(ch <-chan int) {
		n := <-ch //block until 9 is sent
		fmt.Println(n)

		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		done <- struct{}{}
	}(c)
	<-done //block until a value is sent to done
	fmt.Println("bye")
}

// buffered channel
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// A never ending football game
func main() {
	var ball = make(chan string)
	kickBall := func(playerName string) {
		for {
			fmt.Println(<-ball, "kicked the ball.")
			time.Sleep(time.Second)
			ball <- playerName
		}
	}
	go kickBall("John")
	go kickBall("Alice")
	go kickBall("Bob")
	go kickBall("Emily")
	ball <- "referee" //kick off 开球
	var c chan bool   //nil
	<-c               // blocking here forever
}

```

- Channel Element Values are Transferred by Copy。If the passed value size too large, use a pointer element type instead.
- A goroutine can be garbage collected when it has already exited.
- Channel send and receive operatoins are simple statements.

empty select-case code block `select{}` will make current goroutine stay in blocking state forever.

# 22 Methods in Go

Should a method be declared with pointer receiver or value receiver ?

- Too many pointer copies my cause heavier workload for garbage collector
- if value receiver type is Large , should use pointer receiver.
- declaring methods of both value receivers ans pointer receivers for the same base type is more
	likely to cause data races if the declared methods are called concurrently in multiple goroutines.
- values of the types in sync standard package should not be copied.

If it is hard to make a decisoin , just choose the pointer receiver way.
